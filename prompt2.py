#Write a Python that prints the sum of two floating point numbers, the difference between two integers, and the product of a floating point number and an integer. In each case, have the program print out the data type of the resulting answer.

x = 2.5
y = 4.5
z = (x+y)

print(x+y) #prints the sum of two floating point numbers
print(type(z))  #prints the data type of the sum (float)


x = 20
y = 5
z = (x-y)

print(x-y) #prints the difference between two integers
print(type(z)) #prints the data type of the difference(int)


x = 5.5
y = 9
z = (x*y)

print(x*y) #prints the product between one float and one integer
print(type(z)) #prints the data type of the product
